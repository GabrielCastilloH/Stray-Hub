# Model Checkpoints Directory

Place your DogFaceNet model weights here.

## Expected File

```
dogfacenet_weights.h5
```

## How to Obtain Weights

### Option 1: Download Pre-trained Weights

Check the DogFaceNet repository for pre-trained models:
- https://github.com/GuillaumeMougeot/DogFaceNet/releases

### Option 2: Train Your Own Model

1. Navigate to the DogFaceNet directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../DogFaceNet-master
   ```

2. Follow the training instructions in the original README

3. Copy the trained checkpoint:
   ```bash
   cp output/model/*.h5 ../ml/checkpoints/dogfacenet_weights.h5
   ```

## File Format

The weights file should be a Keras HDF5 (.h5) file containing:
- Model architecture (optional)
- Trained weights
- Optimizer state (optional)

The DogFaceNet embedder can load either:
- Full Keras model (architecture + weights)
- Weights only (will be loaded into pre-defined architecture)

## Security Note

Do NOT commit large model files to Git. Add them to .gitignore:

```gitignore
*.h5
*.weights.h5
*.ckpt
```

Consider storing models in:
- Cloud storage (S3, GCS, Azure Blob)
- Model registry (MLflow, Weights & Biases)
- DVC (Data Version Control)
